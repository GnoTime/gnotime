%description
A combination of stop-watch, diary, consultant billing system, and project
manager.  Gnotime allows you to track the amount of time you spend on a task,
associate a memo with it, set a billing rate, print an invoice, as well as
track the status of other projects.

Some people may remember Gnotime in its previous incarnations as GTT
(Gnome Time Tracker) when it was part of the Gnome Utils package.  It has
been split out, renamed, and greatly enhanced since then.

%changelog
* Tue Feb 08 2005 Mike Traum <mtraum@yahoo.com> - 0:2.2.1-0.fdr.1
- Added guile-devel to BuildRequires
- Changed location of the .desktop file
- Added qof libs, qof header files, and gconf schema which weren't being
  packaged

* Sun Jul 11 2004 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio[AT]tiki-lounge.com> - 0:2.2.1-0.fdr.1
- Upgrade to 2.2.1.
- Remove extraneous BuildRequires.
- Remove doc patches as they've gone in upstream.
- Removed smp flags as this version isn't smp-able.

* Mon Feb 02 2004 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio[AT]tiki-lounge.com> - 0:2.1.7-0.fdr.4
- Fix preun script which was calling gconftool on straw rather than gnotime.
- Add desktop-file-utils Requires and use them to (re)install the .desktop
  file so we can add --vendor and --add-category X-Fedora
- Add StartupNotify to the desktop file

* Wed Dec 31 2003 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio[AT]tiki-lounge.com> - 0:2.1.7-0.fdr.3
- Change the build process back to patching as there is no consensus and I
  agree with the patching argument rather than autogen-in-spec argument.
- Make sure the gconf schema gets installed into the sysconfigdir
- Use gconftool-2 in the post/postun scripts to install the schema into gconf.
- Make scrollkeeper non-optional.  Since most other fedora packages using
  scrollkeeper require it and not having scrollkeeper tends to make help
  unusable.

* Sun Dec 28 2003 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio[AT]tiki-lounge.com> - 0:2.1.7-0.fdr.2
- Fix up the BuildRequires -- if one package will pull in another
  automatically, then do not explicitly list it.
- Change the build process.  Instead of generating a post-autogen patch and
  patching the distributed source, run autogen.sh to regenerate the build
  infrastructure.  (This is necessary in the first place because the doc
  build structure needed to be modified.)

* Mon Dec 15 2003 Toshio Kuratomi <toshio[AT]tiki-lounge.com> - 0:2.1.7-0.fdr.1
- Initial Fedora RPM release.
- Partially adapted from the gnotime.spec.in by Eric Anderson 
  <eric.anderson[AT]cordata.net> from the Red Hat directory in the gnotime
  distribution.
