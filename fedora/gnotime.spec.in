%description
A combination of stop-watch, diary, consultant billing system, and project
manager.  Gnotime allows you to track the amount of time you spend on a task,
associate a memo with it, set a billing rate, print na invoice, as well as
track the status of other projects.

Some people may remember GnoTime in its previous incarnations as GTT
(Gnome Time Tracker) when it was part of the Gnome Utils package.  It has
been split out, renamed, and greatly enhanced since then.
