Fedora Package Build Directory
==============================

If you have a Fedora box you should be able to build this package with::
  rpmbuild -ba gnotime.spec

using this spec file and the distributed tarball to get your own RPM.

Please note that this spec is optimized to get you a working gnotime from
the source package.  It doesn't, however, fix bugs discovered after the source
tarball was released or address the issue of splitting the qof libraries
out of the gnotime package.

For a version of the package that addresses these issues, please look in the
Fedora Extras Project currently hosted at http://www.fedora.us.  At the present
time, the package in question is undergoing QA review at::
  https://bugzilla.fedora.us/show_bug.cgi?id=1158

When it passes QA it'll go into the yum repository at::
  http://download.fedora.us/fedora/fedora/2/i386/RPMS.stable
