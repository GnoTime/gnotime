This template file defines a sample tab-delimited export for
<?scm (gtt-show-project-title) ?>	<?scm (gtt-show-project-desc) ?>

This is pretty broken, and really needs to be replaced by something
along the lines of todo-export.ghtml, whicch works a *lot* better

<?scm (gtt-show-export '($memo $task_time $billable 
$billrate "Sample Column Title for the Billing Rate" 
$value $bill_value))  ?>
