<h1>Invoice for 
<?scm (gtt-show-project-title) ?>
 - 
<?scm (gtt-show-project-desc) ?>
</h1>
</center>

This is a sample invoice
It only shows billable and no-charge hours.
<br><br>
The displayed columns, and the order in which they are displayed,
can be changed by making a copy of the file <tt>"invoice.ghtml"</tt>
(probably in <tt>/usr/share/gtt/ghtml/C/invoice.ghtml</tt>) 
and editing the copy to suit your needs.  When finished, you can 
add the new copy to your system by picking 
the menu item "Reports... New Report".
<br><br>
Note that this table shows tasks that are marked 'free of charge'
as well as those marked 'paid'.  You can modify which tasks are
included in this list by creating your own filter.  Make a copy
of the <tt>'gtt-billable-tasks'</tt> routine, use it as an
example, and modify it to create your own custom list.
(Coming soon -- a more complete set of predefined filters)
