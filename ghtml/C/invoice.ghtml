<h1>Invoice for <?scm (gtt-show-project-title) ?> - <?scm (gtt-show-project-desc) ?></h1>

This is a sample invoice
It only shows billable and no-charge hours.
<br><br>
The displayed columns, and the order in which they are displayed,
can be changed by making a copy of the file <tt>"invoice.ghtml"</tt>
(probably in <tt>/usr/share/gtt/ghtml/C/invoice.ghtml</tt>) 
and editing the copy to suit your needs.  When finished, you can 
add the new copy to your system by picking 
the menu item "Reports... New Report".
<br><br>

<!-- 
The below shows all of the column names that can be displayed with 
the the show-invoice command:

<?scm (gtt-show-invoice '($memo $task_time 
                          $billable $billrate $value $bill_value 
								  $start_datime $stop_datime $elapsed)) ?>

Typically, you will want to show only some of these columns.
-->

<?scm (gtt-show-invoice '($memo $task_time $billable 
$billrate "Sample Configurable Alternate Column Title for the Billing Rate" 
$value $bill_value))  ?>
