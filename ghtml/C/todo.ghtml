<h1>To-Do List</h1>

This is a sample To-Do list
<br><br>
The displayed columns, and the order in which they are displayed,
can be changed by making a copy of the file <tt>"todo.ghtml"</tt>
(probably in <tt>/usr/share/gtt/ghtml/C/todo.ghtml</tt>) 
and editing the copy to suit your needs.  When finished, you can 
add the new copy to your system by picking 
the menu item "Reports... New Report".
<br><br>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Importance</th>
    <th>Urgency</th>
    <th>Title</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    </tr>

<!-- Note that in order to include blank spaces or standard ascii 
     escapes in the scheme markup, you must use double quotes:
	  for example "\t tabbed line followed by newline\n".  If
	  you don't need any blanks or tabs, etc, then you don't need 
	  to quote the string.
 -->

<?scm (gtt-show-projects (gtt-projects) 
      (list ''<tr><td>          gtt-project-importance ''"</td>\n"
            ''<td>              gtt-project-urgency    ''"</td>\n"
            ''<td>              gtt-project-title-link ''"</td>\n"
            ''"<td align=left>" gtt-project-desc       ''"</td>\n"
            ''<td>              gtt-project-status     ''"</td>\n"
            ''"</tr>\n"
            ))
?>
</table>

Below are the project notes, displayed as an ordinary html list.
This list is probably not too pretty-looking, mostly
because your project notes are not filled out or are 
breif and cryptic:
<dl>
<?scm (gtt-show-projects (gtt-projects) 
      (list ''<dt><b>   gtt-project-title   ''"</b></dt>\n"
            ''<dd>      gtt-project-notes   ''"</dd>\n"
            ))
?>
</dl>

That's all Folks!
