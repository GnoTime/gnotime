/* The Idle Dialog is popped up when a project is active (a project

 * when NO project is running, but the keyboard/mouse IS active.
 * The 'activity' project nags you to run a timer.
 *
 * The idle dialog asks the user if they want to restart the
 * idled project, and allows user to credit a variable amount
 * of time to it.
 *
 * Terminology: a project that used to be running, but was auto-stopped
 * due to keyboard inactivity, is called an 'expired' project.  This
 * dialog allows the user to restart expired projects.
