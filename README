What is GTimeTracker?
=====================

GTimeTracker is a combination stop-watch, diary, consultant billing
system and project manager.  You can measure the amount of time you
spend on a task, associate a memo with it, set a billing rate, print
an invoice, as well as track that status of other projects.

running GTimeTracker, feel free to send me an e-mail.
