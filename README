What is GnoTime?
================
GnoTime is a combination stop-watch, diary, consultant billing
system and project manager.  You can measure the amount of time you
spend on a task, associate a memo with it, set a billing rate, print
an invoice, as well as track that status of other projects.

GnoTime used to be called GTT and GTimeTracker, and used to be a 
part of gnome-utils, before being renamed and split out into its 
own package.

Features
========
Please see the GnoTime web page for a list of features.

Status
======
GnoTime has been ported to use Gnome2.  Note, however, that it still
uses some of the older, deprecated widgets; most notably gtkctree.
The new gnome2 treeview widget lacks many of the features needed to
support the keyboard/mouse mannerisms of GnoTime, thereby making
a full port impossible (although one is attempted in src/ctree-gnome2.c).
(The notes at the top of that file describe what's wrong.)

There are still numerous areas of gtt that lack polish.  Please
submit patches that polish up those things that irk you the most.
(Post patches at sourceforge).

Thanks go out to many people who e-mailed me with suggestions and 
bug fixes.  See the "about" window in the app for more details.
