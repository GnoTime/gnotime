Enhancements
------------

Create feature to (auto-)prune old entries from the log.

create invoice for work by day/by week/by month, etc.
create a 'filter' for showing a journal only between certain dates ..

Create a gtt panel applet for switching projects fast.

Optionally allow more than one running project.

Support SQL database for multi-user support; should be easier now,
just mimic the xml file format layout...

Add support for putting billing/customer address into invoices.
i.e. some customizable field ...

Create bonobo component to allow tasks to be put into calendar (e.g.
evolution calender).

New, experiemntal GUI:  (I'm not sure this is a good diea, 
but it may be an interesting way of interacting with the system:)
create a window showing a set of predefined activities:
'read email', 'phone', 'meeting', 'code', 'debug', 'support'
etc.  (user can add new activities).  clicking on an activity
creates a new task with that activity as the memo.

Feature request: is it possible to make gtt change the project depending 
on which window has the focus ? Like if i I am in evolution I'd like 
to mark that time as email, if I am in emacs to "hacking" etc.

Support URL format for the data file: e.g.  postgres://some.host.com/some_db
for sql access.  Have the config file remember the last-accessed URL.

Add support for configurable project states, for example, 
such as adding cost estimates to the project sizing.
Allow user to configure additional states for project status,
in addtion to/instead of the pre-defined ones.  etc.
This could be hard ...

Use Gnome MDI for the top-level windows.

Later:
~~~~~~
Networked version (Server on one machine -- all others are network clients).
Security (but read-only for some users). Viewable / editable on multiple
machines at the same time.

This shouldn't be too hard, since (1) gtt already uses xml, can be shipped 
over the net (2) gtt already has an html viewer.

Maybe we should use XML-RPC for this ??
~~~~~~~~~
Maybe some sort of integration with mrproject?
http://mrproject.codefactory.se/

Maybe some sort of integratin with TouxDoux?

Bugs -- High Priority
---------------------
Documentation has to be updated/finished.

When a project times out due to inactivity, set back the clock by 
the inactivity timeout.

implement 'print' journal for html window ...

support for 'minimum billing blocks' is everywhere, exept in the actual invoice
report. Add it there.

fix annoying cursor shape when dragging projects around

drag-n-drop ir crippled under the sawmill window manager .. not just for
gtt, but for *all* apps that allow dragging within ctree.  Sigh.

export is broken with new heirarchy. Should probably be 
reworked to use ghtml infrastructure, and output to file, 
instead of html viewer.  That way user gets total flexibility 
over export formats.

Bugs -- Low Priority
--------------------
overdue projects should be highlighted in red 

During read of data,  don't destroy old project list until we are sure 
that read of new project list succeeded.

auto-save every xxx minutes

grep for xxx fixme hack alert for additional todo items ... 

implement tooltips when there is a hover over url link

add dialogs for suggested auto-merge intervals when the default values 
are too small (should be 60/300/300, not 3/60/60)

build fancier reports/journals, including 
-- fancier, nicer layout for invoice 
   (including configurable values for printed enums)
-- handle embedded gif/png/jpg

the log file should be gziped on write.

should use local currencies in invoice reports

corba/bonobo stuff
------------------
Implement Bonobo::PersistFile: since we can save data to file
Implement Bonobo::PersistStream: at least in theory, we can pipe the 
xml data format to a stream.
IDL:GNOME/EmbeddablePrint:1.0

More enhancements:
------------------
Display sub-projects in journal as well
>>  If you have hierarchical projects, not only the invoice but also the
>>  journal only shows the 'current' project.  For example, if you have
>>  a project tree that looks like:
>>  
>>    foo
>>    +- foo1
>>    +- foo2
>>  
>>  And you have the following tasks in your Journal:
>>  
>>          foo:
>>                  task1
>>                  task2
>>          foo1:
>>                  bartask
>>          foo2:
>>                  baztask
>>                  quuxtask
>>  
>>  If you view the 'foo' journal you only see 'task1' and 'task2'.
>>  However the times associated with bartask, baztask, and quuxtask are
>>  all still listed in the 'foo' line.  Even if you 'clear' the 'foo'

invoice table display:

>>  I was also expecting the journal entries to be of the form:
>>  
>>          Memo1   Start   Stop    Total
>>          Memo2   Start   Stop    Total
>>          Memo3   Start   Stop    Total
>>  
>>  not
>>          Memo1
>>          Start   Stop    Total
>>          Memo2
>>          Start   Stop    Total
>>          Memo3
>>          Start   Stop    Total
>>  
>>  Then in the journal:
>>  
>>                          Journal for - Jim's Deli
>>  
>>          Memo                    Date            Start   Stop    Total
>>          Initial Install         11/09/01        15:00   18:00   03:00
>>                                  11/10/01        11:00   19:00   08:00
>>                                  11/12/01        12:00   14:00   02:00
>>          Network Configuration   11/12/01        14:00   17:00   03:00
>>                                  11/13/01        14:00   18:00   04:00
